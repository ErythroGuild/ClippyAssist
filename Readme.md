# Clippy Assist

Clippy is back, and here to hang out with you in World of Warcraft!
He's draggable anywhere on your screen, and he'll do his best to be a
good friend.

The addon has a number of slash commands, which can be viewed by typing
`/clippy -help`.

- `/clippy -help`: Lists all commands.
- `/clippy -hide`: Temporarily hide Clippy.
- `/clippy -show`: Show Clippy (if hidden).
- `/clippy -reset`: Resets Clippy's position.
- `/clippy -list`: Lists all available animations.
- `/clippy `{everything else}: Attempts to play that animation.
